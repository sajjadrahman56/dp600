Got it! Let's break down the key Fabric concepts for the DP-600 exam:

### 1. **Tenant**
   - **Definition**: A dedicated space for an organization to manage Fabric items.
   - **Hierarchy**: Maps to the root of OneLake, sitting at the top level.
   - **Alignment**: Integrated with Microsoft Entra ID for identity and access management.

### 2. **Capacity**
   - **Definition**: A set of resources available to perform tasks or produce outputs.
   - **Allocation**: Each tenant can have multiple capacities.
   - **SKU and Trials**: Fabric provides capacity options through Fabric SKUs and trial versions.
   - **Consumption**: Different items consume varying levels of capacity based on usage.

### 3. **Domain**
   - **Definition**: Logical grouping of workspaces.
   - **Purpose**: Helps organize and control access by grouping items logically (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Finance).
   - **Access Management**: Makes it easier for the right individuals to access relevant workspaces.

### 4. **Workspace**
   - **Definition**: A container for items that leverages capacity and provides access control.
   - **Use Cases**: Facilitates collaboration for teams or departments (e.g., Sales workspace may include data warehouses, notebooks, reports, etc.).

### 5. **Fabric Items**

   - **Examples**: Data warehouses, lakehouses, data pipelines, semantic models, reports, etc.
