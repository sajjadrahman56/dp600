Imagine your company has a huge amount of information:

1. Structured data: Organized data, like spreadsheets or tables, such as customer info, sales records, or product inventory. This is stored in a data warehouse (think of it as a highly organized storage room).


2. Unstructured data: Messy or scattered data, like social media posts, website logs, or images, that doesn’t fit neatly into tables. These usually go into a data lake (think of it as a big pond where everything is dumped).



Now, managing these two types of data separately can be difficult because they’re stored differently. To solve this, Microsoft Fabric offers a lakehouse—a combination of both a data lake and a data warehouse. Think of it as a modern storage system that can handle all types of data in one place.

Key terms made simple:

Lakehouse: A storage system that combines the best of a data lake (stores unstructured data) and a data warehouse (stores structured data). It’s like having one big, smart room for all your data.

OneLake: The storage system behind the lakehouse. It’s where your data is kept safe and accessible, no matter its format.

Microsoft Fabric: A platform that helps you store, process, and analyze data using the lakehouse and other tools.


Why it’s helpful:

Instead of using separate systems for structured and unstructured data, your company can use a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric to:

1. Store all types of data in one place.


2. Analyze and make decisions faster, using tools like SQL (a way to ask questions about your data).


3. Handle a large amount of data (scalable).



Think of it as a one-stop shop for all your company’s data, making it easier to organize and use it for better decisions.
